# Project Plan: Enterprise Document Copilot

## 1. Problem
Enterprises store huge amounts of data across multiple platforms. Finding the right information is slow and inefficient at times difficult.  

## 2. Proposed Solution
Build an AI-powered knowledge assistant that uses **document ingestion + vector search + LLM** to provide accurate, contextual answers with citations.  

## 3. Architecture
- **Data Layer:** Document storage Vector DB (Chroma).  
- **Processing Layer:** Document parsing (LangChain).  
- **AI Layer:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLM (Groq).  
- **App Layer:** FastAPI backend + streamlit frontend.  
- **Security Layer:** SSO + RBAC + encryption.  

## 4. Workflows
1. User uploads a document → processed into chunks → embeddings stored in vector DB.  
2. User asks a question → system retrieves relevant chunks → LLM generates response → provides citation.  

## 5. MVP Scope
- Upload & parse PDFs.  
- Basic Q&A chatbot with citations.  
- Web dashboard with login.  

## 6. Future Enhancements
- Integrations (Slack/Teams).  
- Advanced analytics.  
- On-prem deployment.
